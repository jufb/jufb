# Greetings! Ol√°!

I have been a technology enthusiast since childhood. In my fifteens, I published my first website during my technical high school in Data Processing. Since then, I have accumulated over ten years of experience as a software engineer.

My educational background is a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and two graduate certificates in Software Engineering and Project Management.
