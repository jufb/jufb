# Greetings! Ol√°!

### Do you offer innovation, new opportunities, and challenging projects?

Here I am!

I have been a technology enthusiast since childhood. In my fifteens, I published my first website during my technical high school in Data Processing.
Since then, I have accumulated over than ten years of experience, as a software engineer and also as technical project leader.

My educational background is bachelor's degree in Computer Science, two graduate certificates in Software Engineering, and Project Management.
