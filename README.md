<h1>Greetings! Ol√°!</h1>
I am looking for innovation, new opportunities, and challenging projects.
I have been a technology enthusiast since childhood. I published my first website in my fifteens during my technical high school in Data Processing.
I have accumulated ten years of experience, being a software engineer and also a technical leader.
I have bachelor's degree in Computer Science, two graduate certificates in Software Engineering, and Project Management.
